## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to [r.vignesh88@gmail.com] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue.

## Security Considerations

### Default Configurations

This toolkit ships with development-focused defaults that are **NOT suitable for production**:

- Default credentials (Grafana: admin/admin)
- No TLS/SSL encryption
- No authentication for most services
- Permissive network configurations

### Production Security Checklist

Before deploying in production, ensure you:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Enable authentication for all services
- [ ] Implement proper user management
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Consider integrating with your identity provider (LDAP/SAML/OAuth)

#### Network Security
- [ ] Enable TLS/SSL for all web interfaces
- [ ] Use proper firewall rules
- [ ] Restrict network access to trusted sources
- [ ] Consider using a VPN or private network
- [ ] Implement proper network segmentation

#### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt data at rest
- [ ] Encrypt data in transit
- [ ] Implement proper backup encryption
- [ ] Configure log rotation and retention policies
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not logged

#### Container Security
- [ ] Keep base images updated
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use non-root users where possible
- [ ] Implement resource limits
- [ ] Use security contexts

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Monitor for security events
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts

### Service-Specific Security Notes

#### Elasticsearch
- Enable X-Pack security features
- Configure proper index permissions
- Use encrypted communication
- Regular security updates

#### Grafana
- Change default admin password
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure proper user roles
- Disable unnecessary features

#### Prometheus
- Secure metrics endpoints
- Use authentication for write access
- Implement proper retention policies
- Monitor scrape targets

#### AlertManager
- Secure webhook endpoints
- Use encrypted notification channels
- Validate incoming requests
- Implement rate limiting

#### Jaeger
- Secure UI access
- Implement proper authentication
- Configure data retention
- Monitor trace data sensitivity

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated to latest secure versions
2. **Minimal Exposure**: Only expose necessary ports and services
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor all components for security events
4. **Backup**: Implement secure backup procedures
5. **Documentation**: Document your security configuration
6. **Testing**: Regularly test your security measures
7. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents

## Known Security Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
- Metrics may contain sensitive information
- Logs often contain PII or sensitive data
- Traces may expose internal system details
- Consider data classification and handling

### Default Credentials
The following services have default credentials that MUST be changed:
- Grafana: admin/admin

### Network Exposure
All services are configured to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for ease of use. In production:
- Bind only to necessary interfaces
- Use reverse proxies
- Implement proper authentication
