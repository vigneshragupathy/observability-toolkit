# Markdown Link Checker Configuration

This file configures the markdown link checker used in CI to validate external links in documentation.

## Configuration

- **ignorePatterns**: URLs that should be ignored during link checking
  - `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` URLs are ignored since they're only valid when services are running locally
  
- **httpHeaders**: Custom headers for specific domains to avoid bot detection

- **timeout**: Maximum time to wait for link responses

- **retryOn429**: Retry when rate limited (HTTP 429)

- **retryCount**: Number of retry attempts

- **aliveStatusCodes**: HTTP status codes considered as "alive" links

## Usage

This configuration is automatically used by the GitHub Actions workflow during CI/CD pipeline to check for broken external links in markdown files.

## Local Testing

To test link checking locally:

```bash
# Install markdown-link-check
npm install -g markdown-link-check

# Check a specific file
markdown-link-check README.md --config mlc_config.json

# Check all markdown files
find . -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} --config mlc_config.json \;
```
